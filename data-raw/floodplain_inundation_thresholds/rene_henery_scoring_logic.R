# From Rene Henery
# For consistency with the CVHE The logic should be as follows
# (note that I included the scorable days in parentheses to help clarify):
# 1 week:   3 days (days 1-3) growth, 7 days (days 1-7) survival
# 2 weeks: 8 days (days 1-3; 10-14) growth, 14 days (days 1-14) survival
# 3 weeks: 15 days (days 1-3; 10-21) growth , 21 days (days 1-21) survival
# 4 weeks: 15 days(same as above)  growth, 28 (30?) days (days 1-x) survival
