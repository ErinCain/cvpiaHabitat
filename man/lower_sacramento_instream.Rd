\description{
A dataset containing the Weighted Usable Area (WUA) in square feet per 1000 feet
as a function of flow in cubic feet per second
}
\details{
The rearing WUA was derived from a HEC-RAS 1D model. The study's extent is from
the confluence with the Feather River to Freeport (33.4 mi). The CVPIA Lower Sacramento River extends
from the confluence with the American River to Freeport (13.7 mi).

\strong{NOTE:} The CVPIA Lower-mid Sacramento River segment is from Wilkins Slough to the
American River (58.0 mi). To calculate the available habitat, use a proportional combination of
the WUA from the Upper-mid (38.3 mi, 2/3) and Lower (19.7 mi, 1/3) Sacramento instream values.
